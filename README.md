**AI-BASED SECURITY SYSTEM FOR CROWDED AREAS**

**Overview**

This project aims to improve security in crowded areas by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) with existing CCTV networks. The system is designed to optimize surveillance, enhance crowd management, and prevent potential threats through real-time analysis of video feeds.

**Features**

**Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuous surveillance of crowded areas using AI.
**Crowd Analysis:** Detects anomalies in crowd behavior, such as congestion or sudden movement patterns.
**Facial Recognition:** Identifies persons of interest by comparing faces with a pre-existing database.
**Threat Detection:** Recognizes unusual objects or behaviors, such as unattended bags or aggressive actions.
**Alert System:** Sends instant alerts to security personnel when potential threats or anomalies are detected.

**Technologies Used**

**Programming Languages:** Python
**Frameworks: **TensorFlow, OpenCV
**AI/ML Technologies:** Machine Learning models for object detection, image processing, and pattern recognition.
**Hardware**: Integrates with existing CCTV cameras and IoT devices.
Installation Guide
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
OpenCV
TensorFlow
NumPy
Any existing CCTV camera or webcam for real-time video input

**Usage Instructions**

**Setup the camera:** Ensure the CCTV or webcam is connected and configured properly.
**Launch the system:** Run the Python script to begin real-time monitoring.
**Monitor Alerts:** The system will automatically analyze the feed and send alerts if suspicious activities are detected.

**Future Enhancements**

Integrating with drone surveillance systems for extended monitoring.
Expanding the database for facial recognition to improve detection accuracy.
Using heat maps to better track crowd density in real-time.
